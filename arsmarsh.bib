  abstract     = {To meet the need for absolute standards of absorbed dose for X-rays, the National Physical Laboratory together with other national laboratories is investigating methods based on microcalorimetry. The ideal would be to measure “local” absorbed dose in materials such as soft tissue to which water would represent a fairly satisfactory approximation. However, as Report 14 of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements1 states, “the direct determination of the absorbed dose at a point in a liquid (for example, water) has not been feasible primarily because of difficulties of achieving homogeneity of the irradiated system”. An indirect method, in which the absorbed dose is determined in a solid “reference” material, is thus at present used.},

  abstract     = {The difficulties associated with the determination of the equilibrium wall thickness and the associated wall-absorption correction in a cavity ion chamber to be used with radiation of a particular quantum energy are discussed in some detail. It does not appear possible to devise any experiment to measure directly the γ-ray or X-ray absorption in the wall of the chamber. An analytical study has been made of total ionization versus wall-thickness curves from which the required wall-absorption correction is derived.

It appears that electronic equilibrium is not fully achieved in the N.P.L. graphite cavity chambers; but since the wall-absorption correction at present applied is too large, partial compensation for lack of electronic equilibrium is fortuitously achieved.

As a by-product of this analysis, a new method of deriving the relationship between total ionization and atomic number of wall material has been developed for a single chamber. It is suggested that this merits further experimental study with monoenergetic sources.},

Functions have been derived applicable to photon energies in the range 0centerdot03 MeV to 15 MeV, whereby the broad beam attenuation and state of particle equilibrium may be determined for graphite cavity chambers having a wide range of wall thicknesses. The relevance of the new data to various studies of immediate interest is examined.

Stopping power problems in the energy range quoted are also discussed.

Overall correction factors are determined for exposure measurements with graphite cavity chambers used with some X- and γ-ray sources in the photon energy range 0centerdot03 MeV to 15 MeV.},

  abstract     = {Roentgen-calibrated cavity-ionization chambers are frequently used to determine absorbed dose at a point in a tissue-like phantom. An N.P.L. calibration factor for 2 MV X-rays, assigned to a chamber and its associated measuring equipment, includes corrections for wall attenuation of the chamber, for any lack of electronic equilibrium, and for the stopping power of the wall material relative to air. When the chamber readings are used to calculate absorbed dose at a point in, say, a water phantom, a further correction is required to determine the exposure dose that would have been obtained at the point in the absence of the chamber and any wall-thickening cap used in the calibration. Some recent work dealing with the determination of this correction has been critically examined. It is shown that the correction factor required to compensate for the attenuation of the phantom material removed to accommodate the chamber and its cap can be determined from experimental data already available. A rad/roentgen conversion factor for 2 MV X-rays and a water phantom is calculated.},

  abstract     = {n the use of a graphite cavity chamber as a National reference standard for 2 MV X-rays, the roentgen realized for 2 MV X-rays must be consistent with the roentgen realized for, say, 250 KV X-rays by the use of a standard free-air chamber as a National reference standard for medium energy X-rays. The paper describes the work undertaken to assess the extent of agreement between the two sets of reference standards. For obvious reasons, it is not possible to use existing standard free-air chambers to measure exposure with 2 MV X-rays; but it has now become possible to use a graphite cavity chamber to measure exposure with 250 KV X-rays. The results of independent measurements by the cavity chamber and the free-air chamber may thus be compared.

However, the analytical studies of graphite chambers reveal that with 250 KV X-rays more than 90% of the total ionization arises from photon absorption in an inner skin about 0centerdot001 in. thick surrounding the cavity. Hence, very special precautions have to be taken to avoid contamination of the inner wall of the chamber. Contamination, due to dust from the wear of steel tools, that would be quite insignificant with 2 MV X-rays, can have a profound effect on the behaviour of the chamber when it is used with 250 KV X-rays. A clean graphite chamber was constructed with diamond and ceramic tools.

In spite of uncertainties about the X-ray spectrum used, it is shown that with 250 KV X-rays the N.P.L. exposure standards are consistent to within ± 1%.},

  abstract     = {For more than 30 years the röntgen has been used as the unit for the measurement of X- or γ-ray exposure dose. The definition of this unit, in terms of the ionization produced in air by the high-speed electrons released by the X or γ radiation per 0·001293 g of dry air, strictly requires that account should be taken of the effect of humidity in any absolute determination of the röntgen. At an early stage, Quinton (1936) presented a thesis for correcting for the effect of humidity solely on a gravimetric basis, thus implying that water vapour could be regarded as identical with dry air in all its physical properties, except that of density. It is now known that such an assumption cannot be justified. Correction for humidity solely on the basis of a density difference between dry air and water vapour could lead to errors as large as those obtained by making no correction at all. On the other hand, existing knowledge and experimental data are clearly not wholly adequate for a very precise determination of the effect of humidity. For this reason and further because it does appear that a humidity correction is generally likely to be less than 1 per cent, many workers have preferred to omit consideration of any humidity correction.},

  abstract     = {This article reviews the development and summarizes the state-of-the-art in absorbed dose calorimetry for all the common clinical beam modalities covered in reference dosimetry codes of practice, as well as for small and nonstandard fields, and brachytherapy. It focuses primarily on work performed in the last ten years by national laboratories and research institutions and is not restricted to primary standard instruments. The most recent absorbed dose calorimetry review article was published over twenty years ago by Ross and Klassen (1996 Phys. Med. Biol. 41 1–29), and even then, its scope was limited to water calorimeters. Since the application of calorimetry to the measurement of radiation has a long and often overlooked history, a brief introduction into its origins is provided, along with a summary of some of the landmark research that have shaped the current landscape of absorbed dose calorimeters. Technical descriptions of water and graphite calorimetry are kept general, as these have been detailed extensively in relatively recent review articles (e.g. McEwen and DuSautoy (2009 Metrologia 46 S59–79) and Seuntjens and Duane (2009 Metrologia 46 S39–58). The review categorizes calorimeters by the radiation type for which they are applied; from the widely established standards for Co-60 and high-energy x-rays, to the prototype calorimeters used in high-energy electrons and hadron therapy. In each case, focus is placed on the issues and constraints affecting dose measurement in that beam type, and the innovations developed to meet these requirements. For photons, electrons, proton and carbon ion beams, a summary of the ionization chamber beam quality conversion factors (k Q ) determined using said calorimeters is also provided. The article closes with a look forward to some of the most promising new techniques and areas of research and speculates about the future clinical role of absorbed dose calorimetry.},
